    <h2 id="About-Data">About This Data</h2>
    <p>This data is collected from the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/">City of Chicago data portal.</a>The dataset can be viewed at the<a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Food-Inspections/4ijn-s7e5"> website in a tabular format.</a> The inspections displayed in this website are from restaurants and other establishments who are evaluated by the <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/environ_health/svcs/food_protection_program.html">Chicago Department of Public Health's Food Protection Division.</a></p>
    <h3 id="Risk">Risks</h3>
    <p>Facilities are evaluated at one of three risk levels(high, medium, low). To have a high risk means that a facility has food practices that are likely to negatively affect the public. </p>
    <h3 id="Facilities">Facility Types</h3>
    <ul>
      <p>Restaurant</p>
      <p>Bakery</p>
      <p>Banquet Hall</p>
      <p>Candy Store</p>
      <p>Caterer</p>
      <p>Coffee Shop</p>
      <p>Day Care Center (for ages less than 2)</p>
      <p>Day Care Center (for ages 2 – 6)</p>
      <p>Day Care Center (combo, for ages less than 2 and 2 – 6 combined)</p>
      <p>Gas Station</p>
      <p>Golden Diner</p>
      <p>Grocery Store</p>
      <p>Hospital</p>
      <p>Long Term Care Center(nursing home)</p>
      <p>Liquor Store</p>
      <p>Mobile Food Dispenser</p>
      <p>Paleteria</p>
      <p>School</p>
      <p>Shelter</p>
      <p>Tavern</p>
      <p>Social Club</p>
      <p>Wholesaler</p>
      <p>Wrigley Field Rooftop</p>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="Violations">Violations</h3>
    <p>Every violation has a number assigned to it. The numbers range from 1-44, and a 70. Violations ranging from 1-14 are "Critical" violations, the ones ranging from 15-29 are "Serious", and the rest(30-44 and 70) are considered "Minor".</p>

    <h4>Critical Violations</h4>
    <p>This category includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <!-- Note: Copy pasted -->
      <li>Inadequate storage temperatures</li>
      <li>Inappropriate food handling practices</li>
      <li>Bad personal hygiene</li>
      <li>Rodent and/or insects infestations</li>
      <li>Lack of hot running water</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These types of violations create an immediate health hazard that carries a greater risk of causing food-borne illness (disease carried to humans through food). Critical violations identified during an inspection must be corrected immediately. If the business fails to do so, it fails the inspection, receives a citation, and has its business license suspended. The business owner is required to correct the violation(s) and contact the Chicago Department of Public Health to schedule an inspection to reopen the business</p>
    
    <h4>Serious Violations</h4>
    <p>This category includes such occurrences as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Potentially hazardous food improperly thawed</li>
      <li>Re-serving food previously served to another customer (except for packaged food in its original unopened packages)</li>
      <li>Food not properly protected from contamination during storage, preparation, display, service, and transportation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These types of violations create a potential health hazard if not corrected in the timeframe specified by the Department of Public Health. Serious violations identified during an inspection, if not immediately corrected, result in a failed inspection. However, the business license is not suspended as in the case of Critical violations. A failed inspection will result in an automatic re-inspection within a period determined by the Department of Public Health.</p>

    <p>When the food establishment is inspected, a Serious violation from the previous inspection that has not been corrected is upgraded to a Critical violation. This Critical violation requires the establishment to immediately cease operation. It also results in a citation and the suspension of the business license.</p>

    <p>If a business immediately corrects all Serious violations, the inspection will be given a Pass with Conditions status. No re-inspection is required until the next routine inspection but the business does not get a full passing grade.</p>

    <h4>Minor Violations</h4>
    <p>This category includes such occurrences as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Poorly constructed, unclean, or dilapidated walls, ceilings, or floors</li>
      <li>Improper storage of soiled and clean linens, coats, and aprons</li>
      <li>Unauthorized personnel in the food-prep area</li>
    </ul>


    <p>These types of violations are less likely than Critical or Serious violations to contribute to food contamination or illness and do not pose an immediate threat to the public’s health. Citations are not issued for Minor violations. However, Minor violations that are not corrected within the timeframe specified by the Department of Public Health are upgraded to Serious violations and the inspection is failed. A Serious violation due to an uncorrected previous Minor violation results in a citation.</p>

      <h3>General</h3>
      <p>This app is written in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>. <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/">Flask-SQLAlchemy</a>, <a href="http://flask-restless.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Flask-Restless</a>, <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/">Jinja2</a>, and <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">Requests</a> are used to handle the backend. The scraper is ` every friday on the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/">City of Chicago data portal.</a> After the scrape the data has been heavily parsed and seperated into different components. Currently the database scheme contains six different tables and each of their use is explained in the <a href="#In-Depth">'In-Depth Discussion'</a>..

      <h4>Source Code</h4>
      <p>The complete source code is available on Github[insert link here].</p>

      <h4>Contributing</h4>
      <p>The project is very young and in need of improving. We are very open to new ideas on how the code, infrastructure, and design can improve. Feel free to hack on the project and ask for a pull request. Also if you find any bugs just open a Github issue and we will give it our full attention.</p>

      <h4>Server Side</h4>
      <p>Everything on the server side is programmed with Python! The scraper(though it is also a parser) is ran every friday. All the data is saved into a SQLite database using the SQL-Alchemy module. Flask-Restless in a really abstract way takes the database models and turns them into a ReSTful API. After that Flask and Jinja2 take over. Taking adavantage of Flask's easy and powerful routing approach all the content is served dynamically via templating.</p>
      <h4>Client Side</h4>
      <p>This app isn't very heavy on the client side. jQuery is used wherever possible over raw javascript and Backbone. The only place where Backbone is used is on the inspections table. With Backbone we are able to load the data from the api asynchronously. After all the data is loaded from the API it is updated to the DOM using Underscore's _.template() function. If any of this is new to you then we recommend you this[insert link here]. It is a great post and it will get you up to speed. </p>
      <h4>API</h4>
        <p>The API is currently available to all who want to access the data directly without throttling or charge. As mentioned before it is created with Flask-Restless. The full documentation and on making queries is already available so we will jump right into some examples.</p>
