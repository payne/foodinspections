To Write About:
3. !Change from one huge model into a break down of the data. And deciding to implement Branch/facility/inspection model vs insection or facility/inspection model

4. Try to finish your models first then your views, when you realize how much better the models can bem the views will break.

5. Switch from nested tables to ul because of responsive design

6. Switch from server side to client side for sorting abilities on inspection-tables.

7. Api difference between returning just an array(chicago data portal), and returning more info and fields with actual data types. The order of how fields appear(how i gotta fix mine)
  Article, "The JSON API user interface."

9. Responsive Design.

10. Search Algorithims fun!

11. Databse joins and why they are needed!

12. Check your FUCKING MODELS and QUERIES LOL.({% for inspection in violation.inspection %} 
  <p><a href="{{ url_for('inspection_blueprint.show_inspection', id=inspection.inspection_id) }}">{{ inspection.facilities.branch_name }}</a></p>
  {% endfor %})

Things to keep in mind when designing:
  1. Transitions on links
  2. Transformations on images, with transitions and box shadow possibly
  3. Transformations to the side ex: rotate(-10deg)
  4. Ability to skew items with skew transformations
